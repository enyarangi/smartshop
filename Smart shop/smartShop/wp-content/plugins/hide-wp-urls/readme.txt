Hide Admin and Login does not work for Multisites, Nginx and IIS. Only <a href="http://wpplugins.tips/wordpress" target="_blank">Hide My Wordpress PRO</a> version does.

The admin URL is the most common path that hackers use to break your Wordpress site.

If you don't protect yourself, you will end up having a hacked site sooner or later.

This is the free version of the plugin so you can use it for all your blogs without any restrictions.

Note: The plugin requires custom permalinks. Make sure you have it activated at Settings > Permalinks
